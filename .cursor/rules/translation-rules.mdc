Whenever dealing with text (pages, backend messages, errors, components, etc), always do through translations using resources/lang/en + any other language folder existing there. So if a message was created to one language, it needs to be created on every other language as well.

Translations JSON doesn't accept nested objects.

Always follow other translation key patterns.

Generic keywords (like Apply, Save, Cancel, Saving, Applying, Close, etc), needs to be put on general.json.
